## The website you're on now

### Development Process
Created over the course of 2 days, I was primarily focused on getting back into the swing of things while also making an original project. I have spent the last few months studying various technologies and looking for a job, and have not been able to work on anything I personally enjoy. I hope this effort kickstarts my habit of building while also reigniting my passion for active software development.

I have more ideas for this website, but will be shifting focus to other projects in the meantime to update the pages with.
